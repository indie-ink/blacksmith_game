# **My first blacksmith game**  
*An adventure where crafting is as important as combat... but way more relaxing (and no monsters to slay... yet).*

## What is this game about?

Welcome to **Blacksmith Quest**, a **2D crafting simulator** where you take on the role of a humble blacksmith. Your job? To **forge weapons** and satisfy customers in a post-apocalyptic world!  
Your customers will bring you orders for **swords**, **daggers**, **axes**, and more, and it’s up to you to gather materials, heat them in the **furnace**, hammer them on the **anvil**, and cool them off in a **barrel of water**. It’s the ultimate **blacksmith experience**, minus the sweat and the hammer injuries!

But that’s not all! There are **secret recipes** for ancient weapons waiting to be discovered, and mysterious **merchants** who visit your shop with rare ingredients. Are you ready to craft your own legendary creations?

## Key Features:
- **Crafting with Love**: Heat ore, hammer on the anvil, cool your weapons, and repeat the cycle to make the best weapons in the land!
- **Customer Orders**: Satisfy your customers by crafting the exact weapon they ask for. Just don’t mess up — they’ll pay better for the right weapon!
- **Merchants with Secrets**: Occasionally, merchants will stop by with **ancient recipes** for powerful weapons. Who knows what new creations you’ll unlock?
- **Unlock New Weapons**: Visit the **general store** to unlock new types of weapons as your blacksmithing skills improve.
- **Relaxing Gameplay**: It’s like a cooking game, but instead of food, you’re creating powerful weapons.
